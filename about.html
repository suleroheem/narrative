          I’m Bryn — a freelance digital product designer with over 10 years of
          experience. I care a lot about using design for positive impact.
          Currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

        <p>
          I was most recently working at Denmark’s newest unicorn, Pleo. They
          raised the biggest Series C Denmark has seen. Before that I worked for
          Monzo — the fastest growing bank in the UK. I led product design for
          over 4 million customers. I worked across multiple product squads
          solving complex money problems. Before Monzo — I was the first
          design-hire at health startup, Thriva. I led all of Thriva’s design
          output. From digital products, to test kit packaging, to marketing
          like their tube campaign. I was the 6th hire and the company grew to
          35 whilst there. I played a big part in scaling the product team and
          processes. Over the years I’ve worked across health, non-profit,
          design tooling, finance, retail, automotive and telecoms. From
          early-stage startups like Thriva, to FTSE 100 companies like
          Morrisons, to hypergrowth businesses like Monzo. I’ve also worked with
          some pretty awesome brands like Adidas, Microsoft and Mastercard.
